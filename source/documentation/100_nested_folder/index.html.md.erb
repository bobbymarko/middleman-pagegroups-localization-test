# <%= current_page.data.title %>

- All of these documents are part of the `nested_folder` group. This is because
  the source directory they reside in is named `nested_folder/`.

- This particular page is the index page of the group, and is considered the
  parent of all of the other files.
  
  - This page does not have an `:order` key set; its order is based on its
    original containing directory name.  

  - The other pages are set via their `:order` keys instead of a via a naming
    prefix.
