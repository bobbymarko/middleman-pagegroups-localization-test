To get the most benefit from `middleman-pagegroups` you will most likely want
to use [partials](partials) and/or [helpers](helpers) in your layouts. This 
sample project does such.

Let’s examine a couple of examples from this very project.


## `template-logo-medium`

Most of this site’s pages use this layout.

~~~ haml
= wrap_layout ('layout'.to_sym) do
  .container-logo-medium
    %div
      .yield-content
        ~ yield
        - if current_page.navigator_eligible?
          %hr
          = nav_prev_next

    %div
      %div
        = image_tag 'middleman-pagegroups-small.png', :alt => 'middleman-pagegroups logo'
      .related_topics
        %h1 Related Topics
        = nav_brethren_index

        - if content_for?(:seeAlso)
          %h1 See Also
          = yield_content :seeAlso
~~~

We can immediately see that this layout is wrapped by another layout, `layout`,
that we’ll look at shortly. Within this file are two interesting sections:

~~~ haml
        - if current_page.navigator_eligible?
          %hr
          = nav_prev_next
~~~

This checks the current page with the `resource.navigator_eligible?` method,
and then includes the navigation controls using the `nav_prev_next` helper if
it’s so. This page (the one you’re looking at), includes the navigator controls
as a result of this code.

Next, this code:

~~~ haml
        %h1 Related Topics
        = nav_brethren_index
~~~

…provides all of the Related Topics for every page of this site using this
template (which is most of them).

Have a look at `template-logo-large` and `template-logo-small` to find similar
code.


## `layout`

The `layout.haml` provides the outer wrapper for every page of this
documentation. Aside from providing all of the required HTML boiler plate, it
contains some interesting code:

~~~ haml
  %body{:class => "#{page_classes}"}
    %nav#breadcrumbs
      = nav_breadcrumbs_alt
    = yield
~~~

First, it uses the `page_classes` helper that Middleman projects do by default,
but in this case the `page_name` and `page_group` will be included. This isn’t
used by any CSS in this particular project, but it’s available when needed.

Also because this is the outer wrapper for every page, it's a good place to
add the breadcrumbs navigator at the top of the page, using the
`nav_breadcrumbs_alt` helper.
