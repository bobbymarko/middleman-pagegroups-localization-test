Thanks for having a look at `middlemac-pagegroups`! This documentation is an
example of “eating your own dog food,” and uses the features of this extension
to demonstrate itself.

`middleman-pagegroups` principally enables **automatic navigation** via the
management of **sort order**, **groups** (including nested groups), and making
a determination about the **legitimacy** of these relationships.

It provides sample partials to enable **breadcrumbs**, **previous** and 
**next** buttons, **tables of contents**, and **related pages**, all using the
concepts that enable automatic navigation.

The extension itself is quite simple; it adds a few methods to each resource
(those that you access with `current_page`, as well as several helpers, and if
you prefer to use partials, `middleman-pagegroups` can even generate some sample
partials for you.

<%= nav_legitimate_children %>

The table of contents above is the result of using the `nav_legitimate_children`
helper; all of the data comes automatically from the front matter of the files
that are part of this `source` group.
